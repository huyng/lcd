Installation
============

lcd is focused on being a lightweight library that you can install using a package manager or add directly to your project. Below you'll find instructions for both methods.



Using a package manager
-----------------------

pip::

    pip install lcd


easy_install::
    
    easy_install lcd

Installing from source
----------------------

The core logic of lcd is and always will be located within a single file. You can include it directly into a folder in your project. Just make sure that it's somewhere in your `sys.path` so that you can import it. Here's the file you'll need to copy into  your project::
